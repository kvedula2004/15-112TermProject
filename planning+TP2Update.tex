completed generalized shoelace alg, intersections
completed ellipse, ellipse distance, ellipse closest point

Point {
    object point is on (if its on a certain object, trying to move it will
    keep the glue between the point and object)
}

Polygon {
    can also move polygon!
}

Sidebar and Button {
    used for UI
    can select objects
    collapsible headers
    click on circles for hide/unhiding object
}

remove regular polygon (not important)
remove the triangle center plan (probably don't have time + simply computation)


old planning:

# CLASSES #
###########

Point {
    x coordinate
    y coordinate
    label
    label dx and dy coordinate
    can move (bool)
    object point is on
    currently drawn (or hidden)
}

Line {
    label
    label x and y coordinate
    two points on line
    currently drawn (or hidden)
}

LineSegment {
    same as line
}

Polygon {
    label
    list of points
    index1, index2, ....
    currently drawn
}

RegularPolygon(Polygon) {
    point1, point2
    number of vertices
    # trig bash time
}

Circle {
    center
    radius or other point

    or

    three points
}

Ellipse {
    two foci
    point on perimeter
}

# ALGORITHMS #
##############

shoelace {
    shoelace algo for computing area of polygons
}

intersections {
    gradient flow: 
    start at a point
    see which direction decreases the most (w/ radius 1)
    repeat with radius 0.1, and radius 0.01
    all for 1000 iterations
    repeat for all compass directions on corner
    if you are close (distances approx 0), then return good points
    if not, no intersection
}

ellipse draw {
    compute equation by pain
    Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0
    for all x which make discriminant nonzero, draw circle with small radius
    make sure it doesn't look ugly
}

ellipse distance {
    binary search!
    see if intersection with circle of radius r and ellipse (by equation)
}

# maybe if time

triangle centers {
    computing incenter, circumcenter, orthocenter, centroid by math
}
